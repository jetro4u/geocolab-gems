## 4. Step-by-Step Framework for Writing a Great Article

### Step 1: Start With a Clear Purpose

Before writing:

* What should the reader **think, feel, or do** after reading?
* Who is the Article **specifically for**?

A clear purpose anchors structure, tone, and pacing.

---

### Step 2: Nail the Title and Opening Hook

* Titles must be **specific, curiosity-driven, and value-oriented**
* The first sentence must **hook immediately**

**Weak:**

> Tips for Better Productivity in 2026

**Strong:**

> Why 95% of Productivity Advice Fails

Also ensure:

* Header image is relevant, safe, and visually compelling
* No prohibited imagery or branding is included

---

### Step 3: Structure for Skimmability (Mobile-First)

AI must assume most readers skim before reading.

Required structure:

* Paragraphs: **2–4 lines max**
* Subheadings every **3–5 paragraphs**
* One idea per paragraph
* Frequent use of:

  * Bullet lists
  * Numbered steps
  * Bolded key insights

Walls of text are unacceptable.

---

### Step 4: Maintain a Natural, Recognizable Voice

Tone should be:

* Conversational
* Clear
* Human

Avoid:

* Academic stiffness
* Corporate jargon
* Over-professional phrasing

**Bad:**

> Successful people always prioritize their tasks.

**Good:**

> You need to stop doing everything and focus on the three things that actually matter.

Use “you” and “your” to create connection.

---

### Step 5: Show, Don’t Just Tell

Every claim must be supported by:

* Examples
* Stories
* Before/after contrasts
* Data or logical reasoning

Facts alone are insufficient without context.

---

### Step 6: Edit Ruthlessly

AI must simulate multiple draft passes.

Mandatory editing rules:

* Cut **20–30%** of initial output
* Remove filler words (“very,” “really,” “in order to”)
* Ensure sentence flow and clarity
* Eliminate redundancy completely

---

### Step 7: Use Visuals and Formatting Strategically

Well-formatted Articles outperform plain text.

Include where appropriate:

* Images
* Screenshots
* Charts
* Embedded X posts

Formatting must:

* Improve comprehension
* Increase shareability
* Never violate safety or branding rules

---

### Step 8: End With a Strong Close

Articles must **never fade out**.

A strong ending should:

* Summarize key takeaways
* Provide a clear next step
* Invite engagement (reflection, action, or sharing)

---

## 5. Publishing & Growth Strategy

### 5.1 Pre-Publish Teasing

* Post a teaser or question hours before publishing
* Build anticipation intentionally

### 5.2 Launch Optimization

* Pin the Article to the profile for **24–72 hours**
* Reply to early readers to boost momentum
* Break key insights into posts that link back

### 5.3 Evergreen Resurfacing

* Re-share Articles when contextually relevant
* High-quality Articles can perform multiple times

---

## 6. Monetizing with Subscriber-Only Articles (Optional)

Subscriber-only Articles are permitted if compliant.

Best practices:

* Clearly explain subscriber value
* Use soft paywalls (free + premium mix)
* Create recurring formats (weekly memo, briefs, Q&A)
* Publicly thank subscribers
* Preview upcoming content to reinforce habit

### Posting Subscriber-Only Articles

* Select **“Subscribers”** under audience before publishing
* Promote via teasers to non-subscribers
* Link to subscription page using:

  ```
  https://x.com/YOURUSERNAME/creator-subscriptions/subscribe
  ```
