      "text": "🚀 Creator OS Beta — Phase 1 (Core Cohort: 20 Creators)\n\nI’m building Creator OS — an AI-powered creator intelligence layer that predicts viral content using Expected Future Attention (EFA), not vanity metrics.\n\nI’m opening Phase 1: Core Cohort for 20 creators to manually test the Triple-Loop scoring system before full automation.\n\nThis is a controlled experiment — not an open beta.\n\n🧪 What You’ll Do (10 mins/day · 7 days)\n\n🟢 Day 1 — Setup (≈5 mins)\n\nShare your X handle\n\nI fetch your profile data via Grok\n\nYou receive your Creator Intelligence Object (CIO) — a data snapshot showing:\n🧠 EFA Baseline → your future viral potential\n🏛️ Authority Score → network-weighted influence\n⚡ Idea Velocity → how fast your ideas spread\n😮‍💨 Fatigue Risk → pattern saturation warning\n👥 Audience Quality → engagement vs followers\n\n🔁 Days 2–7 — Testing Loop (5–10 mins/day)\n\nGenerate 5 candidates/week\n→ 3 posts + 2 replies\nGet instant viral probability scores (0–100%)\nPublish ONLY ≥67% candidates (our hard filter rule)\nLog outcomes after 24h (likes, replies, clicks, etc.)\nExport your results as a JSON bundle\n\n🎁 What You Get\n\n⚡ Immediate Value\n✅ Your personal Creator Intelligence Profile\n✅ Viral probability scores before you post\n✅ Topic-to-creator fit analysis (what works for your audience)\n✅ Regret & fatigue warnings (avoid burnout patterns)\n\n🏆 After Testing\n🎟️ Early access to Creator OS (lifetime Pro tier)\n📊 Personalized 7-day optimization report\n🎤 Attribution in launch materials (with consent)\n💡 Direct input into the product roadmap\n\n👥 Who I’m Looking For (Very Important)\nI need diversity across creator tiers to validate the scoring logic.\n\nTiers\nExplorer \n- Followers: <5k\n- Slots: 5\n- Why: High volatility, viral spikes possible\n\nCatalyst \n- Followers: 5k–50k\n- Slots: 8\n- Why: Best testing group, algorithm-friendly\n\nAuthority\n- Followers: 50k–250k\n- Slots: 5\n- Why: Trust-weighted distribution\n\nTitan\n- Followers: 250k+\n- Slots: 2\n- Why: Graph amplification dominates\n\n📊 Live slots (updating):\nExplorer: 0 · Catalyst: 0 · Authority: 0 · Titan: 0\n\n⚠️ If a tier fills up, remaining interest goes to the waitlist for Phase 2.\n\n🛠️ The Tech (Why This Is Different)\nCreator OS uses a Triple-Loop Architecture:\n\n⚡ Loop 1 — Fast Path\nInstant viral filter → rejects weak ideas before scoring\n\n🎯 Loop 2 — Fit Scoring\nTopic + style alignment for your specific audience\n\n🔮 Loop 3 — EFA Forecast\nAuthority + velocity + trend heat − fatigue risk\n\n❌ Not based on:\n\nFollower count alone\nPast engagement only\nGeneric “best practices”\n✅ Based on:\n\nYour creator genome (style, tone, audience quality)\n\nAttention durability (not spikes)\n\nRegret avoidance (pattern saturation detection)\n\n📋 Requirements\nActive on X (3+ posts/week)\nWilling to share public profile data\nCan commit ~10 mins/day for 7 days\nComfortable with simple web tools (no coding)\nOpen to honest feedback\n\n🚦 How to Join (Phase 1)\nReply or DM with:\nYour X handle\nYour creator tier (Explorer / Catalyst / Authority / Titan)\nYour primary topics (e.g. “AI, startups, productivity”)\n\nI’ll reply within 24h with:\nYour CIO (Creator Intelligence Object)\nAccess to the testing platform\nQuick-start guide\n\n⏳ First come, first served — by tier.\nOverflow goes to Phase 2 waitlist.\n\n🔒 Privacy & Data\nData stored locally during testing\nYou control all exports (JSON)\nNo public sharing without consent\nWithdraw anytime → data deleted\n\n❓ FAQ\nDo I need coding skills?\nNo — simple web interface.\n\nWhat if I miss a day?\nNo problem. Catch up when you can.\n\nCan I test without publishing?\nYes — but publishing + logging gives the best insights.\n\nWill this work for my niche?\nYes. The system adapts to your creator genome.\n\nWhat happens after 7 days?\nYou get your report + early access.\nPhase 2 opens with a new cohort.\n\n🎯 Why I Built This\n\nMost creators optimize for:\n\n👉Impressions (vanity)\n👉Engagement rate (easily gamed)\n👉Follower growth (slow feedback loop)\n\nCreator OS optimizes for Expected Future Attention —\nthe only metric that predicts sustainable creator success.\n\nThis is the intelligence layer missing from creator tools.\n\nReady to test?\nReply with handle + tier + topics 👇\n\nP.S. If you know creators in underrepresented tiers (especially Titans), please tag them. Diversity = better validation. 🚀",

      "text": "🔄 Moderator Summary Post — Starlink Discussion\n\n*“Starlink’s Super Bowl spotlight has sparked a wide range of reactions — from excitement about global coverage to frustration over pricing, regional availability, and product positioning. This isn’t just a product debate. What’s emerging is a deeper conversation about *access, expectations, and what connectivity means in different parts of the world.”\n\nKey themes in the replies so far:\n\n🔹 Access vs Expectations:\nSome users celebrate Starlink as transformative where traditional internet doesn’t reach, while others point out it doesn’t yet meet expectations in challenging terrain or pricing in developed markets.\n\n🔹 Global Perspective:\nInterest ranges from questions about availability in countries like India to comparisons with local ISPs — highlighting that “affordability” isn’t a universal concept.\n\n🔹 Future vs Present Tradeoffs:\nDiscussions about satellite congestion, convergence with cellular, and using infrastructure for off-Earth logistics show that people are thinking beyond the product itself.\n\n🔹 Real vs Hype:\nSupporters cheer its potential impact, while critics see mismatch between broad ads (like the Super Bowl) and niche early-stage utility.",
